A [Laravel Analytics](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-analytics) widget collection for Statamics Control Panel.

This repository contains the code for these widgets. While the code is open-source, it's important to remember that you'll need to purchase a license before using this addon in production. Licenses cost \$5 and can be purchased from the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/seller/products/289).
